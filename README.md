# scrape-epl-news
In this project I used apache airflow to scrape website periodically. This is for the tutorials I do on youtube. You can checkout my channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzSlSeJ4XH4bWH79DKmIxjg). I do data science and data engineering videos for projects like these.

## using the project
You can follow these steps to setup and you can use [this video]() to help you understand what is going on.
1. Clone this repository.
2. cd into the repo 
```
cd scrape-epl-news
```
3. Run `setup_steps` to install dependencies. Make sure you are using `pyenv` to manage your python versions and `python 3.9.9` is installed in the pyenv manager.
```
bash scripts/setup_steps.sh
